# Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy
# Project: Government Complaint Management System

## 1. Introduction and Guiding Philosophy

The goal of this Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy is to launch the Citizen Complaint Management System in a structured, phased manner. This approach is designed to mitigate risks, gather crucial user feedback at each stage, and ensure the final product is stable, user-friendly, and effective.

Our philosophy is to **"Test, Learn, and Scale."** We will start with a small, controlled group to validate the core product, then expand to a larger, but still limited, group to test the system under real-world conditions, before finally rolling it out to the public. Product development milestones will be directly aligned with the needs of each phase.

## 2. Phase 1: Internal Pilot

*   **Core Goal:** To validate core functionality, identify major bugs, and gather initial usability feedback in a completely controlled environment.
*   **Duration:** 1 Week.
*   **Users:** 5 internal municipal employees. These users will be selected to represent different roles (e.g., 2 will act as "Admins," 3 will act as "Citizens").
*   **Product State for this Phase:**
    *   The product can be in its initial prototype state, using **`localStorage`** for data persistence. This is sufficient for testing the UI flow without a full backend.
    *   The application will be deployed to a private or non-publicized Cloudflare Pages URL.
*   **Execution Plan:**
    1.  **Onboarding:** Conduct a single 30-minute session to walk the 5 users through the application and the goals of the pilot.
    2.  **Test Scenarios:** Provide users with a clear checklist of tasks to perform, such as:
        *   Submit a new complaint with a photo.
        *   Log in as an admin.
        *   Find the new complaint in the dashboard.
        *   Assign the complaint to an officer.
        *   Mark the complaint as completed, uploading a "proof of completion" photo.
    3.  **Feedback Collection:** All feedback (bugs, suggestions, points of confusion) will be collected in a simple shared document or via a dedicated email address.
*   **Success Milestones:**
    *   [ ] All 5 users successfully complete 100% of the test scenarios.
    *   [ ] A consolidated list of at least 10-15 actionable feedback items is created.
    *   [ ] A "Go/No-Go" decision is made for the MVP phase based on the pilot feedback. Critical bugs must be fixed before proceeding.

## 3. Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Private Beta

*   **Core Goal:** To test the end-to-end system with real users and real complaints, and to achieve a critical mass of 50 logged complaints to validate the system's utility and stability.
*   **Duration:** 4-6 Weeks.
*   **Users:**
    *   **Citizens:** An "allowlist" of 20-30 selected individuals from a specific neighborhood or ward. This group should consist of community leaders, local representatives, and engaged citizens who have agreed to participate.
    *   **Admins:** 2-3 designated municipal officers who will be the official administrators for this phase.
*   **Product State for this Phase:**
    *   **CRITICAL UPGRADE:** Before this phase begins, the backend **must be built and deployed**. The application must be using Cloudflare Workers for logic, D1 for the database, and R2 for image storage. The `localStorage` model must be fully replaced.
    *   The application will be on its final production URL, but the submission form will be protected (e.g., via a simple shared password or by using Cloudflare Access to only allow the "allowlisted" users).
*   **Execution Plan:**
    1.  **Onboarding:** Separate onboarding sessions for the citizen group and the admin officers.
    2.  **System Monitoring:** The engineering team will closely monitor API error rates, database performance, and image upload success rates.
    3.  **Weekly Check-ins:** Conduct a brief weekly call with the admin officers to discuss their experience with the dashboard and workflow.
    4.  **Feedback Session:** At the end of the phase, hold a group feedback session with the citizen participants.
*   **Success Milestones:**
    *   [ ] **Primary Milestone:** The system successfully logs and processes **50 real complaints**.
    *   [ ] The backend infrastructure (Workers, D1, R2) runs without any critical failures for the duration of the phase.
    *   [ ] A feature backlog for the public launch is created based on the feedback from both user groups.

## 4. Phase 3: Public Launch - Phased Rollout

*   **Core Goal:** To successfully launch the system to all citizens of Mayiladuthurai, manage the initial wave of users, and establish a process for continuous improvement.
*   **Duration:** 2-3 Months for the initial rollout, then ongoing.
*   **Users:** The general public.
*   **Product State for this Phase:**
    *   The application is fully public. All access restrictions are removed.
    *   Features and bug fixes identified during the MVP phase have been implemented.
    *   Robust monitoring and alerting are in place to notify the team of any system issues.
*   **Execution Plan (Staggered Rollout):**
    1.  **Month 1 - Ward-by-Ward Launch:**
        *   Begin by publicizing the system in only 1-2 designated municipal wards.
        *   Use hyper-local communication channels: posters in local government buildings, announcements by local representatives, etc.
        *   This limits the initial user load, allowing the team to manage support and monitor system health closely.
    2.  **Month 2 - City-Wide Awareness:**
        *   Expand publicity to all remaining wards.
        *   Launch a broader, but still modest, communication campaign on the municipality's official social media pages and website.
    3.  **Month 3 - Full Public Availability:**
        *   The system is now the primary, officially promoted channel for submitting sewage-related complaints.
        *   A "Provide Feedback" link is added to the website to create a continuous feedback loop.
*   **Success Milestones:**
    *   [ ] A measurable increase in complaints submitted via the online system, correlated with a decrease in complaints via phone/paper.
    *   [ ] System uptime remains above 99.9%.
    *   [ ] A product roadmap is established for ongoing feature development based on public feedback.
