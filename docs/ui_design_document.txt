## 1. User Personas

This section defines the key users of the system, their goals, and their pain points.

### Persona 1: The Citizen

*   **Name:** Ananya
*   **Role:** A resident of the Mayiladuthurai municipality.
*   **Bio:** Ananya is a 30-year-old school teacher who is comfortable using web applications on her smartphone. She is a proactive member of her community and is concerned about local civic issues, such as sanitation and road maintenance.
*   **Goals:**
    *   To report a civic issue (like a sewage leak) quickly and easily.
    *   To feel confident that her complaint has been officially received and logged.
    *   To be able to track the progress of her complaint without having to make phone calls or visit a government office.
*   **Frustrations:**
    *   Confusing and cluttered government websites that are difficult to navigate.
    *   "Black hole" systems where complaints are submitted but no feedback is ever received.
    *   Not knowing the correct department or person to contact for a specific problem.

### Persona 2: The Government Administrator

*   **Name:** Mr. Kumar
*   **Role:** A mid-level officer in the Municipal Sanitation Department.
*   **Bio:** Mr. Kumar is a 52-year-old administrator responsible for overseeing a team of field workers. He is often busy with paperwork and managing daily operations. He is moderately tech-savvy but prefers tools that are straightforward and help him organize his work efficiently.
*   **Goals:**
    *   To have a single, clear overview of all complaints assigned to his department.
    *   To easily prioritize tasks and assign them to his field officers.
    *   To maintain a clear, documented record of when a complaint was received, assigned, and resolved, including photo evidence.
    *   To reduce the time spent on manual record-keeping (paper forms, logbooks).
*   **Frustrations:**
    *   Receiving complaints through multiple channels (phone, in-person, email) makes them difficult to track.
    *   Forgetting to follow up on a complaint due to a lack of a centralized system.
    *   Having no simple way to prove that work has been completed, leading to disputes.

## 2. User Journeys

This section outlines the step-by-step paths that users will take to accomplish their goals.

### Journey 1: A Citizen Submits a New Complaint

1.  **Landing:** Ananya finds a sewage leak in her street. She accesses the web application on her phone.
2.  **Form Interaction:** The homepage immediately presents the "Submit a Sewage Complaint" form. She fills in the required fields: Location, Description, and her Contact Number.
3.  **Image Upload:** She taps the "Upload Photo" area, which opens her phone's camera or gallery. She takes or selects a photo of the leak. A preview of the image appears on the form.
4.  **Submission:** She reviews the details and taps the "Submit Complaint" button.
5.  **Confirmation:** A success modal appears with the message: "Complaint Submitted Successfully! Your complaint has been registered with ID: #1001." Ananya makes a note of the ID. The system has successfully met her need to report an issue and feel confident it has been logged.

### Journey 2: An Admin Manages and Assigns a Complaint

1.  **Login:** Mr. Kumar starts his day by logging into the Complaint Management System via the "Admin Login" link.
2.  **Dashboard Review:** He lands on the Admin Dashboard. The "Pending" stat card shows there are new complaints. He scans the "Complaint Registry" table and sees the new complaint, #1001.
3.  **Assignment:** He assesses the complaint and decides to assign it to a field team. He clicks the "Assign" button on the row for complaint #1001.
4.  **Action:** An "Assign Officer" modal pops up. He selects "Field Officer Priya Sharma" from the dropdown list and clicks "Assign Officer".
5.  **Status Update:** The modal closes. In the dashboard, the status for complaint #1001 automatically updates from "Pending" to "In Process", and "Priya Sharma" now appears in the "Assigned To" column. Mr. Kumar has successfully delegated the task.

### Journey 3: An Admin Resolves a Complaint

1.  **Resolution:** Two days later, Priya's team resolves the sewage leak and sends a photo of the cleaned street to Mr. Kumar.
2.  **Locate Complaint:** Mr. Kumar logs in and finds complaint #1001. He sees its status is "In Process".
3.  **Initiate Completion:** He clicks the "Mark Complete" button.
4.  **Provide Proof:** A "Mark Complaint as Completed" modal appears, prompting him to upload a photo of the resolved issue. He uploads the photo he received from Priya.
5.  **Finalize:** With the photo uploaded, the "Mark as Completed" button in the modal becomes active. He clicks it.
6.  **Confirmation:** The modal closes. The status for complaint #1001 is now "Completed", and the action area shows a green checkmark. Mr. Kumar has successfully closed the loop and created a permanent record of the resolution.

## 3. Frontend Design and Wording Guide

This section establishes a consistent style for all user-facing text and design elements to ensure the application is clear, trustworthy, and easy to use.

### 3.1. Guiding Principles

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Use plain, direct language. Avoid bureaucratic jargon. The user should never have to guess what a button or label means.
*   **Professional and Reassuring Tone:** The language should convey authority and competence, assuring citizens that their concerns are being taken seriously.
*   **Consistency:** Use the same terminology for the same concepts across all views and modals.

### 3.2. Consistent Terminology

*   **Primary Noun:** **Complaint**. This is the official term for any issue reported by a citizen.
    *   *Avoid:* "Ticket", "Issue", "Case", "Report".
*   **Identifier:** **Complaint ID**. The unique reference number for a complaint.
    *   *Example:* `#1001`
*   **User Roles:** **Citizen** (for the public user) and **Officer** or **Admin** (for the government user).
*   **Complaint Statuses:**
    *   **Pending:** The default state for a newly submitted complaint.
    *   **In Process:** The complaint has been assigned to an officer and is being actively addressed.
    *   **Completed:** The work has been finished and verified.

### 3.3. Key UI Wording

*   **Application Title:** `Mayiladuthurai Municipal Corporation - Citizen Complaint Management System`
    *   *Rationale:* Official, descriptive, and builds trust.
*   **Public View Headline:** `Submit a Sewage Complaint`
    *   *Rationale:* Action-oriented and specific.
*   **Public Form Description:** `Report sewage issues in your area. We will track and resolve your complaint promptly.`
    *   *Rationale:* Sets clear expectations and is reassuring.
*   **Buttons:** Use clear, verb-first labels.
    *   `Submit Complaint`
    *   `Admin Login`
    *   `Assign Officer`
    *   `Mark as Completed`
    *   `View Details`
*   **Success Message:** `Complaint Submitted Successfully! Your complaint has been registered with ID: [Complaint ID]. Please save this ID for future reference.`
    *   *Rationale:* Positive reinforcement, provides critical information, and instructs the user on the next step.
*   **Admin Dashboard Title:** `Complaint Registry`
    *   *Rationale:* Sounds official and accurately describes the content.

### 3.4. Visual Design Language (Based on existing CSS)

*   **Color Palette:** The design effectively uses the Indian national colors (saffron, white, green) in the header to establish a strong, official government identity. The primary action color is a shade of green (`#138808`), which intuitively signals "go," "success," and "completion." Status badges use a clear color-coded system (yellow for pending, blue for in process, green for completed) for at-a-glance comprehension.
*   **Typography:** The use of a system-native sans-serif font stack ensures the text is highly readable, modern, and performs well across all devices without needing to load custom fonts.
*   **Layout and Spacing:** The interface is clean and uncluttered, with generous use of whitespace. Content is organized into logical cards and sections, which helps to focus the user's attention and prevent them from feeling overwhelmed. This is especially important for a government application, which users might expect to be dense and confusing.
