## 3. For Developers & Testers: Using Test Tools

To accelerate testing and development, a set of developer tools has been added.

### How to Use the Test Data Seeding Feature

This feature instantly fills the complaint submission form with valid sample data.

You can trigger this feature in three ways:

1.  **Floating Button (Recommended):**
    *   Navigate to the main complaint submission page.
    *   A small, blue floating button with a "🔧" icon will be visible at the bottom-right of the screen.
    *   Click this button to instantly populate the form fields.

2.  **Keyboard Shortcut:**
    *   While on the main page, press **`Ctrl + Shift + D`** (or **`Cmd + Shift + D`** on macOS).

3.  **URL Parameter:**
    *   Add `?seed=true` to the end of the website URL (e.g., `https://your-site.pages.dev/?seed=true`). The form will be auto-filled on page load.

**Note:** After seeding the data, you still need to manually upload a photo before you can submit the complaint.
