# Master Product Requirements: Government Complaint Management System

*Version: 1.0* 
*Date: 2025-11-09*

## 1. Executive Summary

The Government Complaint Management System is a web-based platform designed for the Mayiladuthurai Municipal Corporation. Its purpose is to empower citizens to easily report civic issues, starting with sewage and drainage problems, and to provide municipal officers with a powerful tool to track, manage, and resolve these complaints efficiently.

The project directly addresses the "Infrastructure and Enforcement Gap" common in rapidly growing cities, where traditional methods of managing civic issues are overwhelmed. By leveraging technology to crowdsource problem identification, the system enables a data-driven approach to governance, allowing the municipality to prioritize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency.

The product will be developed and launched in three phases: an **Internal Pilot** to validate core functionality, a private **MVP Beta** to test the end-to-end system with real users, and a phased **Public Launch**. The technical architecture will evolve from a simple client-side prototype to a robust, scalable serverless backend using Cloudflare Workers, D1 (database), and R2 (image storage), ensuring security and scalability.

## 2. Business Context & Success Metrics

### 2.1. Summary
The core business problem is the significant public health and environmental crisis caused by inadequate sewage management in urban areas. This system provides a cost-effective, technology-driven solution that enables the government to become more efficient and data-driven in its response. By empowering citizens to act as distributed sensors, the municipality can better prioritize resource allocation, improve transparency, and ultimately enhance public health and trust.

Success will be measured not just by system adoption but by tangible improvements in operational efficiency (e.g., reduced complaint resolution time) and long-term public health outcomes (e.g., a reduction in waterborne diseases).

## 3. Core Features & User Journeys

### 3.1. Summary
The system is designed around two primary user personas: the **Citizen (Ananya)** and the **Government Admin (Mr. Kumar)**. The core user journeys reflect their primary goals:

*   **Citizen Journey:** A citizen visits the public-facing portal, fills out a simple form with the complaint's location and description, uploads a photo of the issue, and receives a unique Complaint ID upon submission.
*   **Admin Journey:** An admin logs into a secure portal, views a dashboard of all complaints, assigns new complaints to specific officers, tracks the status of ongoing work, and marks complaints as "Completed" by uploading photographic proof of resolution.

## 4. UI/UX Design

### 4.1. Summary
The user interface is guided by principles of **clarity, trust, and consistency**. The design uses a clean, modern layout with a professional color palette (leveraging Indian national colors) to build credibility. All user-facing language is simple, direct, and reassuring, avoiding bureaucratic jargon. A strict terminology guide (e.g., always using "Complaint" and "Complaint ID") ensures a consistent and intuitive user experience across the platform.

## 5. Engineering Design & Architecture

### 5.1. Summary
The project will be developed in two main technical phases to align with the Go-To-Market strategy.

*   **Phase 1 (Internal Pilot):** A client-side-only application using **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and the browser's **`localStorage`** for data persistence. This allows for rapid prototyping and UI validation.
*   **Phase 2 (MVP & Public Launch):** A scalable serverless architecture built on the **Cloudflare ecosystem**. The frontend remains a lightweight static site, which communicates with a backend API powered by **Cloudflare Workers**. Complaint data will be stored in a **D1 database**, and all images will be stored in an **R2 bucket**. This architecture is secure, scalable, and cost-effective.

## 6. Go-To-Market (GTM) Plan

### 6.1. Summary
The launch will follow a structured, three-phase GTM strategy to ensure a smooth rollout and incorporate user feedback.

1.  **Internal Pilot:** A 1-week test with 5 internal users to validate the core user flow using the initial prototype.
2.  **MVP Private Beta:** A 4-6 week test with a limited group of real citizens and officers to validate the end-to-end serverless system and achieve a goal of 50 real complaints.
3.  **Public Launch:** A phased, multi-month public rollout, starting with a few city wards and gradually expanding to cover the entire municipality.

## 7. Deployment & Infrastructure

### 7.1. Summary
The entire application will be deployed and managed on the Cloudflare platform. The frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) is served as a static site via **Cloudflare Pages**, providing a fast, global CDN, and seamless CI/CD from a GitHub repository. The backend, including the API, database, and image storage, leverages Cloudflare's serverless products (Workers, D1, R2). All secrets and environment variables (API keys, admin credentials) will be managed securely within the Cloudflare dashboard.
