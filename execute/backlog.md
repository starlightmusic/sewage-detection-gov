# Product & Feature Backlog

This document contains a running list of ideas, feature requests, and potential future Epics. Items from this list can be prioritized and promoted into a formal Epic.

## Feature Ideas

*   **Notifications System (SMS/Email):**
    *   Send an SMS to the citizen when their complaint status changes (e.g., from "Pending" to "In Process").
    *   Send an email to the assigned officer with the details of the new complaint.

*   **Advanced Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Add charts and graphs to visualize complaint data (e.g., complaints per week, average resolution time).
    *   Add a map view to show the geographic distribution of complaints.
    *   Implement filtering and searching functionality for the complaints table.

*   **Citizen User Profiles:**
    *   Allow citizens to create an account to see a history of all complaints they have submitted.
    *   This would enable them to track statuses without needing to save the individual Complaint IDs.

*   **Multi-language Support:**
    *   Add a language switcher to support both English and Tamil.

*   **Expanded Complaint Categories:**
    *   Allow citizens to submit complaints for other categories beyond sewage (e.g., "Broken Streetlight," "Pothole," "Garbage Collection").

*   **Internal Commenting:**
    *   Allow admins to add private notes or comments to a complaint for internal communication.
